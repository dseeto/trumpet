*Kruskal's Algorithm*
=====================
	We used a hash table to store all of the vertices in the graph. In the hash table, each vertex was the key, and 
		the value was an Integer which allowed us to relate that vertex to a location in the disjoint sets object.
		This allowed constant-time access to the appropriate entry in the disjoint sets object, regardless of what type
		of object the user wants to store in the graph's vertices.
		
	In order to acquire a list of all edges, we start with an empty graph. Then, we iterate through the vertices of the
		graph being evaluated, and we find all of the neighbors of each of these vertices. This takes O(V + E) time, since
		the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to or less than two times the number of edges in the graph, and we
		are iterating over the degrees of all vertices, and we are also iterating over all vertices. Each time that we
		find a pair of neighbors (i.e. an edge) which has not yet been placed into our new, originally empty graph, we add
		that edge to our edge array. Then, we sort the array, and then we apply Kruskal's algorithm in a very straightforward
		manner.
		
	We used quicksort to sort the vertices in O( |E|log(|E|) ) time, and because of the use of a hash table, the whole algorithm
		runs in O( |E|log(|E|) + V ) time, since creating a list of all edges takes O(V) time.
		

====================
 *EDGES & VERTICES*
====================
	Edges and Vertices are represented as nodes in a linked list of Edges. This is a doubly-linked list with a Sentinel node.
	For the list of vertices, the sentinel node is held in the WUGraph object.
	
	For edges, each vertex contains a linked list of all edges which connect it to any other vertex, or itself. Two edges
	which connect the same 2 nodes are known as "partners" and they have references to each other. Every edge has exactly
	one partner.
	
	Vertices and edges each have their own hash table, which are stored in the WUGraph object. Each pair of "partner" edges
	is only hashed once in the edge hash table. When an edge is deleted, it is removed from the hash table, then it removes
	itself from its linked list, then its partner removes itself from its linked list. Each edge has a weight.
